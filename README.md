🚀 Machine Learning Project: Optimizing k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier 🤖

In this project, we optimize the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier, a machine learning algorithm that can find patterns in large, high-dimensional datasets. We use a waveform dataset with 5000 instances and 21 features as a case study. The project involves tuning the best k of a kNN classifier by cross-validation, reducing the complexity by running the Data Reduction algorithms, comparing the two methods studied in class for speeding-up the calculation of the 1NN with a brute force 1NN algorithm, and generating artificially imbalancy in the training data and analyzing the impact on the accuracy.
